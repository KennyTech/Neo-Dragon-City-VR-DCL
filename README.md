# Neo-Dragon-City-VR-DCL
 A VR web browser city scene with flying mechanics on the Decentraland platform using Typescript and Node.js
 
## Testing the Scene  
 The web browser scene is deployed on a ZEIT Now server here: https://neo-dragon-city.now.sh/  
 Use WASD to move, your mouse to control the camera, and [Space] to jump.  
 This scene introduces a new mechanic of a controllable flying vehicle (refer to src/game.ts).  
 I hope others may use this as an example to create interesting content on the Decentraland platform.
